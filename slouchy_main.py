"""
Slouchy uses your webcam to determine if you are slouching and alerts you when
you are. This project is still in active development and not feature complete.

Example:
    $ ./slouchy.py [arguments]

Arguments (unimplemented):
    -t, --text-mode    Put slouchy in text mode, disabling all GUI features.
    -g, --gui          Put slouchy in GUI mode (the default). GUI mode normally
                       detaches slouchy from the terminal.
    -h, --help         Print a help message, then terminate.

Attributes:
    config (configobj.ConfigObj): Used to access slouchy's config file. All
        other module level variable get their values from there.
    distance_reference (float): The distance value for the subject when sitting
        upright.
    thoracolumbar_tolerance (float): The ammount of deviation from the
        reference which will be tolerated before reporting the subject is
        slouching.
    cervical_tolerance (float): The amount lateral flexion of the cervical
        before assuming slouching. Note: this and a few other values will be
        integrated into a single model to better discern slouching.
    face_cascade_path (str): The path for the face cascade classifier.
    eye_cascade_path (str): The path for the eye cascade classifier.
    camera_warm_up (int): The Δtime needed for the user camera to initialize.

Modules communicate with named tuples called Maybe. It is designed to emulate
the behavior of Maybe/Either constructs in functional languages.

success (Bool): Indicates whether a given call was successful.

result (Bool/Str): If success is true, result provides accompanying information
                   which is useful or necessary for future calculations.
                   If success is false, result will be a string containing an
                   error message.
"""

# Some pseudo-functional programming here: use of namedtuples to simulate the
# Maybe/Either construct throughout this program. Success is always True or
# False, indicating whether a requested action has succeeded. If success is
# True, result contains the calculation results. Otherwise, result contains an
# error message
